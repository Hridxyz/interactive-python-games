# Interactive Programming in Python Projects

Welcome to my collection of interactive programming projects developed during my minor in Interactive Programming in Python, part of the "Fundamentals of Computing Specialization" by Rice University.

## Overview

This repository contains a series of games and interactive applications built using Python and SimpleGUI. Each project is a mini-game that demonstrates various programming principles, mathematical concepts, and problem-solving skills learned throughout the course.

## Projects

### Blackjack
A classic card game where the goal is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closest to 21 without going over.

### Guess The Number
A simple number guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly selected number within a certain range.

### Memory
A memory puzzle game where the player has to match pairs of hidden cards.

### Pong
A recreation of the classic arcade game Pong, where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth.

### RiceRocks
An asteroid-shooting game inspired by the classic arcade game Asteroids.

### Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
An extended version of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game with additional choices: Lizard and Spock.

### Shrubbery
A whimsical game inspired by Monty Python where players navigate a knight through various challenges.

### Spaceship
A space shooter game where the player controls a spaceship to avoid obstacles and shoot enemies.

### StopWatch
A simple stopwatch game where the player tries to stop the timer at exactly 10 seconds.

### 2048 (Merge)
A variation of the popular 2048 puzzle game where the player merges tiles with the same numbers to reach the 2048 tile.

### 2048
The classic 2048 puzzle game implemented in Python.

### Tic-Tac-Toe (Monte Carlo)
An advanced version of Tic-Tac-Toe using the Monte Carlo method for decision-making.

### Yahtzee
A Python implementation of the classic dice game Yahtzee.

### Cookie Clicker
An idle game where the player clicks on a cookie to earn points and buy upgrades.

### Zombie Apocalypse
A simulation game where the player has to survive a zombie apocalypse by managing resources and avoiding zombies.

### Word Wrangler
A word puzzle game where the player has to form as many words as possible from a given set of letters.

### Tic-Tac-Toe (Minimax)
A more advanced Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Minimax algorithm for optimal play.

### The Fifteen Puzzle
A sliding puzzle game where the player has to arrange tiles in numerical order.

## Getting Started

To run any of these projects, ensure you have Python and SimpleGUI installed. You can install SimpleGUI using the following command:

```sh
pip install simplegui
```

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interactive-programming-python.git
```

Navigate to the project directory and run the desired game script:

```sh
cd interactive-programming-python
python Blackjack.py
```
